# Core UI framework
streamlit

# Image handling
Pillow

# Core AI / Deep Learning Libraries (Install PyTorch separately based on CUDA/CPU needs)
# See: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# Base torch - might need specific version or CUDA variant from PyTorch website
torch
torchvision
torchaudio

# Hugging Face Libraries for Diffusion models and Training
diffusers
transformers
accelerate # For launching training script
safetensors # For model weight handling

# Optional but recommended for training performance/memory saving on GPU
bitsandbytes # Required for 8-bit Adam optimizer (check compatibility, mainly Linux/WSL)

# Optional but sometimes needed by transformers/CLIP for text processing
ftfy

# Note:
# - For GPU support (required for efficient fine-tuning), install the correct PyTorch version
#   for your CUDA setup from the official PyTorch website BEFORE running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
#   or install it afterwards, potentially overwriting the basic 'torch' installed by this file.
# - 'bitsandbytes' installation might require specific steps depending on your OS (especially Windows/macOS).
# - You might need to install development tools (like build-essentials on Linux, or Visual Studio build tools on Windows)
#   for some dependencies.
